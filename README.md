# Challenge-1

## Horiseon
Building a better online presence. I was motivated to improve the code for this website so that it would have greater analytics, be targeted in online searches, and be more accecible to people who require additional aids when navigating websites. Web accessibility is an important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google.

### What I learned
I learned how to use semantic HTML to replace excessive use of divs. And in restructuring an already written code I also learned how to adjust the CSS code so that nothing was lost visually with how the website was built. I also reorganized and cleaned up the CSS code so that it would be easier to go through at a later stage when more code was built onto this project.

### What I achieved
I cleaned up the code in a way which will make future projects on this webpage flow easier and more quickly.
